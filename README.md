## Setup
### Build & Code
This Project is managed by maven. To build the project you need to have a internet connection or the dependencies cached locally. In order to run the project you would need a stable release of java 1.8

## Deploy
### Fat file
To deploy this Application to customers we implemented a fat file version which will need Java installed but includes all the specified dependencies within. Just build and clean the application and in the target directory of the project a file called ```Adressverwaltung-jar-with-dependencies.jar``` will show up which is the one.
### External libraries
In order to use external libraries please use the ```Adressverwaltung.jar``` which seems tiny bu all the oder folders are needed in the root directory of the jar file or globally known to java. Please make sure you're running a environment with all the libraries in the globally used by java or excecute the jar file within the folder where all the other folders a placed in.
